# Make-Notes Webapp

The Make-Notes Webapp is a React-based web application that allows users to create, edit, and delete notes. The application currently uses createPortal and useState to provide a smooth user experience. This README file will guide you through the process of adding a login feature to the backend of the application

## Getting Started

To get started with the Make-Notes Webapp, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Once you've installed these dependencies, you can clone the repository and install the required packages:


## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbhirajkarBajpai/Make-Notes-Webapp.git
cd make-notes-webapp
npm install
```
```bash
npm start
```


## Run Webapp
The application should be available at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## What's Next
In the future, we plan to add a login feature to the Make-Notes Webapp. This will allow users to securely store and access their notes by requiring authentication before they can access the application.

We are currently working on implementing a backend API that can handle user authentication, and we plan to update the frontend of the application to include a login form that allows users to enter their credentials.

If you have any suggestions or feedback on how we can improve the Make-Notes Webapp, please don't hesitate to contact us or open an issue on our GitHub repository. We are always looking for ways to make our application better and more user-friendly.
